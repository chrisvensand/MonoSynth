# Welcome! What is this?
MonoSynth is a free, easy to use [monophonic synthesizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphony_and_monophony_in_instruments). The frontend was developed using React and the audio was generated using [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/). This project was a way for me to learn sound synthesis and React at the same time. It still has some problems so whenever the sound starts glitching, refresh the page and you should be good to go.
